# MDA-DMC
The code for the paper Channel and Hardware Impairment Data Augmentation for Robust Modulation Classification (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475695).
Before running fe_optimize.py be sure that you prepared all required datasets.
File dataAugmentation_clean.py generates the augmented dataset. Other datasets are generated through MATLAB (https://github.com/ErmaPerenda/Modulation-dataset-generation-in-MATLAB).
